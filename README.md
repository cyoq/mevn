# mevn
## MEVN application example

Run through Docker using
```
docker-compose up
```
- hosts on http://localhost:8081
- server works on http://localhost:3031
- database works via port 27017

REST API requests are made via http://localhost:3031/characters.

If you want to use it separately, then you need **vue-cli** which can be installed via
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Then install all packages in client and server folders using
```
npm install 
```
